## Experiment 2: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Objective
To study and implement Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality
reduction of a dataset.

### Description
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to
reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving maximum variance.
It transforms the original features into a new set of uncorrelated
features called principal components.

### Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

### Outcome
The experiment demonstrates how PCA reduces dimensionality and
explains the variance captured by each principal component.
