## Experiment 1: Data Preprocessing and Statistical Analysis

### Objective
To study preprocessing methods and compute statistical measures such as
mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, quartiles, and interquartile range.

### Description
This experiment focuses on understanding the importance of preprocessing
by analyzing the distribution and spread of a dataset before applying
machine learning algorithms.

### Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Pandas

### Outcome
Gained insight into data distribution and variability, which helps in
preparing data for machine learning models.
